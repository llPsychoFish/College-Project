    <p>
      Many legendary creatures from mythology may have been inspired by real
      animals. Here are some fascinating examples:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Unicorns</strong> – Believed to be inspired by the Indian
        rhinoceros or narwhals.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dragons</strong> – Possibly based on large reptiles like Komodo
        dragons or fossilized dinosaur bones.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mermaids</strong> – Sailors may have mistaken manatees or
        dugongs for mermaids from afar.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Griffins</strong> – Fossils of Protoceratops (a dinosaur)
        might’ve inspired the idea of a lion-eagle hybrid.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Kraken</strong> – Likely based on sightings of giant squids in
        the deep sea.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It’s amazing how ancient people turned real-life animals into magical
      legends that still capture our imagination today!
