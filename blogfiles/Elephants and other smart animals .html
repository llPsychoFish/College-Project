      <h2>Elephants: The Gentle Giants with Incredible Memories</h2>
      <p>
        Elephants are renowned for their intelligence, empathy, and especially
        their memory. They live in complex social groups led by a matriarch, and
        their relationships can last a lifetime. Elephants can remember the
        locations of water sources and migration routes for decades, and they
        never forget a friend—or an enemy. They have been observed mourning
        their dead, comforting distressed companions, and even recognizing
        themselves in mirrors (a sign of self-awareness).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Memory:</strong> Elephants can recall distant watering holes
          and recognize individuals after many years apart.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Communication:</strong> They use a wide range of
          vocalizations, body language, and even seismic signals (vibrations
          through the ground) to communicate over long distances.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Problem-solving:</strong> Elephants have been seen using
          tools, such as sticks to scratch themselves or plug water holes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Empathy:</strong> They comfort and help injured or distressed
          herd members and have been seen showing compassion to other species.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="fact-box">
        <strong>Did you know?</strong> Elephants have the largest brains of any
        land animal and can recognize themselves in a mirror—a rare trait in the
        animal kingdom!
      </div>

      <img src="images/crow.jpg" alt="Crow" />
      <h2>Crows: The Feathered Geniuses</h2>
      <p>
        Crows and other corvids (like ravens and magpies) are among the smartest
        birds on Earth. They have demonstrated the ability to use tools, solve
        complex puzzles, and even plan for the future. Crows can recognize
        individual human faces and remember those who have threatened or helped
        them.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Tool Use:</strong> Crows use sticks, leaves, and even their
          own feathers to extract insects from hard-to-reach places.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Problem-solving:</strong> They can solve multi-step puzzles
          and have been observed dropping nuts onto roads for cars to crack
          open.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Social Intelligence:</strong> Crows work together to mob
          predators and share information about food sources.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Memory:</strong> They remember human faces and can hold
          grudges or show gratitude for years.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="fact-box">
        <strong>Did you know?</strong> Crows can count, mimic sounds (including
        human speech), and even hold "funerals" for dead crows!
      </div>

      <img src="images/dolphin 1.webp" alt="Dolphin" />
      <h2>Dolphins: The Playful Problem-Solvers</h2>
      <p>
        Dolphins are famous for their playful nature and high intelligence. They
        live in social groups called pods and communicate with a variety of
        clicks, whistles, and body movements. Dolphins have been observed using
        tools, such as covering their snouts with sponges to protect themselves
        while foraging on the seafloor.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Communication:</strong> Dolphins use unique signature whistles
          as names for each other and can understand complex instructions from
          humans.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cooperation:</strong> They work together to herd fish, rescue
          injured pod members, and even help humans in distress.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Play:</strong> Dolphins play games, surf waves, and use
          objects for entertainment—signs of advanced intelligence.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Self-awareness:</strong> Like elephants, dolphins can
          recognize themselves in mirrors.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="fact-box">
        <strong>Did you know?</strong> Dolphins have been seen teaching their
        young how to use tools and even passing on cultural behaviors!
      </div>

      <img src="images/octopus.jpg" alt="Octopus" />
      <h2>Octopuses: The Masters of Escape</h2>
      <p>
        Octopuses are invertebrates, but their intelligence rivals that of many
        mammals. They have large brains, excellent problem-solving skills, and
        the ability to learn through observation. Octopuses are famous for their
        escape artistry—many have broken out of aquariums by unscrewing lids or
        squeezing through tiny gaps.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Tool Use:</strong> Some octopuses use coconut shells or rocks
          as portable shelters or shields.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Camouflage:</strong> They can instantly change color and
          texture to blend into their surroundings, avoiding predators and
          sneaking up on prey.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Learning:</strong> Octopuses can solve mazes, open jars, and
          remember solutions to puzzles.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Short Lifespan, Fast Learners:</strong> Despite living only a
          few years, octopuses learn quickly and adapt to new situations.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="fact-box">
        <strong>Did you know?</strong> An octopus has three hearts and blue
        blood—and can regrow lost arms!
      </div>

      <img src="images/pig.jpg" alt="Pig" />
      <h2>Pigs: The Surprising Scholars</h2>
      <p>
        Pigs are often underestimated, but they are among the most intelligent
        domesticated animals. They have excellent long-term memories, can learn
        tricks, and even play video games with joysticks! Pigs are highly social
        and can recognize themselves in mirrors.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Learning:</strong> Pigs can be trained to respond to their
          names, solve puzzles, and perform tricks as quickly as dogs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Memory:</strong> They remember locations of food and can
          navigate mazes with ease.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Social Skills:</strong> Pigs communicate with a wide range of
          grunts and squeals and form close bonds with other pigs and humans.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Self-awareness:</strong> Pigs have passed the mirror test,
          showing they recognize their own reflection.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="fact-box">
        <strong>Did you know?</strong> Pigs can dream, just like humans, and
        have been shown to display empathy toward other pigs!
      </div>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        These animals prove that intelligence comes in many forms—from memory
        and problem-solving to empathy and communication. Next time you see an
        elephant, crow, dolphin, octopus, or pig, remember: there’s a lot going
        on behind those eyes!
