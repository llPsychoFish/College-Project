    <h1>Ocean Oddities: Creatures of the Deep</h1>
    <img src="ocean-oddities.jpg" alt="Ocean creatures" />

    <p>
      The deep sea is one of the least explored parts of our planet — and it's
      full of bizarre creatures you've probably never seen before!
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Anglerfish</strong> – Uses a glowing lure to attract prey in the
        dark depths.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Giant Squid</strong> – Rare and elusive, with eyes as big as
        dinner plates.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Goblin Shark</strong> – A “living fossil” with a long, flat
        snout and extendable jaw.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vampire Squid</strong> – Despite its spooky name, it’s harmless
        and glows in the dark.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Barreleye Fish</strong> – Has a transparent head and eyes that
        point straight up!
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The ocean is still full of mysteries — and these creatures remind us how
      strange and amazing life can be underwater.
