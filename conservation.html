            <h2>Extinct & Endangered Species</h2>
            <p><strong>Extinction</strong> marks the irreversible end of a species when its last member dies, while <strong>endangered species</strong> are those teetering on the brink of extinction. Our planet has witnessed the tragic loss of countless magnificent creatures, and many more are fighting for survival today.</p>
            <p>Each extinction represents not just the loss of a unique life form, but the unraveling of intricate ecological relationships built over millions of years. From the gentle Dodo to the mighty Woolly Mammoth, these species remind us of our responsibility as stewards of Earth's biodiversity. Understanding their stories is the first crucial step toward preventing future losses and protecting the vulnerable species that remain.</p>

                            The dodo was a gentle, ground-nesting bird that became extinct in the late 17th century due to hunting and introduced species. It is a symbol of human-caused extinction and the importance of protecting vulnerable species.

            <h2>Hybrids & Clones</h2>
            <p><strong>Hybridization</strong> occurs naturally when two related species interbreed, creating offspring with traits from both parents. However, modern <strong>scientific cloning</strong> allows us to create genetically identical copies of organisms, opening new frontiers in conservation biology.</p>
            <p>While natural hybrids like mules have served humanity for millennia, today's advanced reproductive technologies offer hope for saving endangered species through genetic preservation. From Dolly the sheep's groundbreaking birth to attempts at cloning extinct species, these scientific achievements raise profound questions about the ethics and possibilities of genetic intervention in conservation efforts.</p>

            <h2>Major Threats to Wildlife</h2>
            <p>Wildlife faces numerous threats, primarily driven by human activities. Understanding these challenges is crucial for effective conservation.</p>

            <h3>Poaching</h3>
            <p>Poaching is the illegal hunting or capturing of wild animals. It's a significant threat to many endangered species, driven by demand for animal parts (like rhino horn, elephant ivory, and pangolin scales) in illegal wildlife trade. This illicit trade is often run by organized crime syndicates and devastates populations, pushing species closer to extinction.</p>
            <h4>Illicit Fishing</h4>
<p>
Illicit fishing threatens marine life and local economies. It includes fishing without permits, ignoring limits, and using banned tools. These actions damage ecosystems and reduce fish stocks.
do stop illegal fishing. Support strict laws, report violations, and choose sustainable seafood to protect our oceans for the future.
</p>


            <h3>Deforestation</h3>
            <p>Deforestation is the clearing of forests for other land uses, such as agriculture, logging, and urban development. It leads to massive habitat loss and fragmentation, which are primary drivers of biodiversity decline. Animals lose their homes, food sources, and migratory routes, making them vulnerable to starvation, predation, and human conflict. Forests also play a vital role in regulating climate and water cycles, so their destruction has far-reaching environmental consequences.</p>
