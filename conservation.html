                            The dodo was a gentle, ground-nesting bird that became extinct in the late 17th century due to hunting and introduced species. It is a symbol of human-caused extinction and the importance of protecting vulnerable species.

                            Zorses combine the body shape of a horse with the stripes of a zebra. Like other equine hybrids, they are usually sterile and are bred for curiosity or as riding animals.

            <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Major Threats to Wildlife</h2>
            <p>Wildlife faces numerous threats, primarily driven by human activities. Understanding these challenges is crucial for effective conservation.</p>

            <h3>Poaching</h3>
            <p>Poaching is the illegal hunting or capturing of wild animals. It's a significant threat to many endangered species, driven by demand for animal parts (like rhino horn, elephant ivory, and pangolin scales) in illegal wildlife trade. This illicit trade is often run by organized crime syndicates and devastates populations, pushing species closer to extinction.</p>
            <h4>Illicit Fishing</h4>
<p>
Illicit fishing threatens marine life and local economies. It includes fishing without permits, ignoring limits, and using banned tools. These actions damage ecosystems and reduce fish stocks.
do stop illegal fishing. Support strict laws, report violations, and choose sustainable seafood to protect our oceans for the future.
</p>


            <h3>Deforestation</h3>
            <p>Deforestation is the clearing of forests for other land uses, such as agriculture, logging, and urban development. It leads to massive habitat loss and fragmentation, which are primary drivers of biodiversity decline. Animals lose their homes, food sources, and migratory routes, making them vulnerable to starvation, predation, and human conflict. Forests also play a vital role in regulating climate and water cycles, so their destruction has far-reaching environmental consequences.</p>
