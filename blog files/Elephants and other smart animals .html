    <p>
      Some animals are not just cute — they're also incredibly intelligent! Here
      are a few brainy creatures that might just surprise you with how smart
      they are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Elephants</strong> – Amazing memory, strong social bonds, and
        grief rituals.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Crows</strong> – Can use tools and recognize human faces.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dolphins</strong> – Use names for each other and understand
        complex commands.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Octopuses</strong> – Escape artists that solve puzzles in lab
        experiments.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pigs</strong> – Can play video games and have great long-term
        memory.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These animals show that intelligence isn’t limited to humans — the animal
      kingdom is full of clever creatures with impressive abilities.
