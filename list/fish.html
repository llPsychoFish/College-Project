            Fish are aquatic animals that have gills, fins, and a streamlined body. They are cold-blooded and live in water, 
            ranging from freshwater rivers to the vast oceans. Fish play a crucial role in aquatic ecosystems and are a 
            significant source of food for humans and other animals.

                    <p>Bony fishes are the largest group of fish, characterized by their skeleton made of bone rather than cartilage. They have a swim bladder that helps them control their buoyancy, and most have scales covering their bodies. This group includes most of the fish we commonly see in aquariums, rivers, lakes, and oceans.</p>
