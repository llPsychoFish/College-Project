            <p class="par">
            Fish are aquatic animals that have gills, fins, and a streamlined body. They are cold-blooded and live in water, 
            ranging from freshwater rivers to the vast oceans. Fish play a crucial role in aquatic ecosystems and are a 
            significant source of food for humans and other animals.

                    <img src="list_image/barnacle.jpg" alt="Barnacle" />
                    <p>Scientific Name: <b>Cirripedia subclass</b></p>
                    <p>Reproduction Type: <abbr title="They release larvae into water that settle and metamorphose."><b>Oviparous</b></abbr></p>
                    <p>Filter-feeding crustaceans that attach permanently to surfaces like rocks, ships, and whales. They undergo dramatic metamorphosis from free-swimming larvae to sessile adults.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Habitat</h3>
                    <p>Barnacles live attached to hard surfaces in marine environments worldwide, from tide pools to deep ocean. They colonize rocks, piers, ship hulls, and even living animals.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
                    <p>Adult barnacles have cone-shaped shells made of calcium carbonate plates. They extend feathery legs (cirri) to filter food from water and can seal their shells during low tide.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Life Cycle</h3>
                    <p>Barnacles start as free-swimming nauplius larvae, then become cyprid larvae that search for suitable surfaces to attach to permanently. Once attached, they metamorphose into adults.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Feeding Mechanism</h3>
                    <p>Barnacles are filter feeders that extend their cirri to capture plankton and organic particles from the water. They can feed both during high tide and when waves splash over them.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Ecological and Economic Impact</h3>
                    <p>Barnacles provide food for various marine animals and help process organic matter. However, they're also major marine fouling organisms that increase drag on ships and require costly removal.</p>

                    <h2>Cuttlefish</h2>
                    <img src="list_image/cuttlefish.jpg" alt="Cuttlefish" />
                    <p>Scientific Name: <b>Sepiida order</b></p>
                    <p>Reproduction Type: <abbr title="They lay eggs in protective cases and die after reproduction."><b>Oviparous</b></abbr></p>
                    <p>Marine cephalopods with remarkable color-changing abilities and internal cuttlebones for buoyancy control. They are considered among the most intelligent invertebrates.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Habitat</h3>
                    <p>Cuttlefish live in temperate and tropical coastal waters worldwide, preferring sandy or muddy bottoms near coral reefs, seagrass beds, and rocky areas where they can hunt and hide.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Camouflage Mastery</h3>
                    <p>Cuttlefish can instantly change their skin color, pattern, and texture using chromatophores, iridophores, and leucophores. They can mimic backgrounds, display warning patterns, or communicate with others.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Cuttlebone and Buoyancy</h3>
                    <p>The internal cuttlebone is a unique calcified structure that helps control buoyancy by adjusting gas and liquid ratios. This allows precise depth control without energy expenditure.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Hunting and Intelligence</h3>
                    <p>Cuttlefish are ambush predators that use camouflage to approach prey, then rapidly extend their feeding tentacles to capture crabs, fish, and shrimp. They show problem-solving abilities and can learn from experience.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Communication and Mating</h3>
                    <p>Cuttlefish use complex color patterns and body postures to communicate. Males display elaborate courtship patterns and may use deceptive coloration to sneak past rival males during mating.</p>

                    <h2>Nautilus</h2>
                    <img src="list_image/nautilus.jpg" alt="Nautilus" />
                    <p>Scientific Name: <b>Nautilus genus</b></p>
                    <p>Reproduction Type: <abbr title="They lay eggs and have a long reproductive cycle."><b>Oviparous</b></abbr></p>
                    <p>Ancient cephalopods with external spiral shells, often called "living fossils" due to their unchanged form over millions of years. They represent an evolutionary link to early cephalopods.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Habitat</h3>
                    <p>Nautiluses live in deep tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific, typically at depths of 300-2,000 feet. They migrate vertically daily, rising to shallow waters at night to feed.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Shell Structure</h3>
                    <p>The nautilus shell has up to 30 chambers filled with gas and liquid to control buoyancy. The animal lives in the outermost chamber and can adjust its depth by changing the gas-to-liquid ratio.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Primitive Features</h3>
                    <p>Unlike other cephalopods, nautiluses have external shells, simple eyes without lenses, and up to 90 tentacles without suckers. They rely more on chemical sensing than vision.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Conservation Status</h3>
                    <p>Nautiluses are considered vulnerable due to overharvesting for their shells and slow reproduction rates. They can live over 100 years but don't reproduce until they're 15-20 years old.</p>

                    <img src="list_image/giant_squid.jpg" alt="Giant Squid" />
                    <p>Scientific Name: <b>Architeuthis dux</b></p>
                    <p>Reproduction Type: <abbr title="They lay eggs and die after reproduction."><b>Oviparous</b></abbr></p>
                    <p>Massive deep-sea cephalopods that can grow up to 43 feet long, making them one of the largest invertebrates on Earth. They have inspired legends of sea monsters for centuries.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Habitat</h3>
                    <p>Giant squids inhabit deep ocean waters worldwide, typically at depths of 1,000-3,000 feet. They prefer the twilight zone where there's minimal light penetration.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
                    <p>Giant squids have the largest eyes in the animal kingdom (up to 10 inches across) and feeding tentacles that can extend to catch prey. Their beaks are as hard as parrot beaks.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Predator-Prey Relationship</h3>
                    <p>Giant squids are primary prey for sperm whales, leading to epic deep-sea battles. Evidence of these encounters is found in whale stomach contents and scars on whale skin.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Mystery and Research</h3>
                    <p>Giant squids were only first filmed alive in 2004. Much about their behavior, reproduction, and ecology remains mysterious due to their deep-sea habitat.</p>

                    <img src="list_image/blue_ringed_octopus.jpg" alt="Blue-ringed Octopus" />
                    <p>Scientific Name: <b>Hapalochlaena genus</b></p>
                    <p>Reproduction Type: <abbr title="Females die after laying eggs and caring for them."><b>Oviparous</b></abbr></p>
                    <p>Small but deadly octopuses known for their brilliant blue rings that appear when threatened. Despite their beauty, they carry enough venom to kill 26 adult humans.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Habitat</h3>
                    <p>Blue-ringed octopuses live in tide pools and coral reefs in the Pacific Ocean from Japan to Australia. They prefer shallow, warm waters with plenty of hiding spots.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Warning Display</h3>
                    <p>When threatened, their normally brown camouflaged skin displays bright blue rings as a warning signal. This is one of nature's most beautiful but dangerous warning displays.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Venom and Danger</h3>
                    <p>Their saliva contains tetrodotoxin, the same neurotoxin found in pufferfish. The venom causes paralysis and respiratory failure, and there's currently no antidote.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Size and Behavior</h3>
                    <p>Despite being only 4-6 inches long, blue-ringed octopuses are fearless and will bite if handled. They're normally docile but become aggressive when cornered.</p>

                    <img src="list_image/vampire_squid.jpg" alt="Vampire Squid" />
                    <p>Scientific Name: <b>Vampyroteutis infernalis</b></p>
                    <p>Reproduction Type: <abbr title="They have a unique reproductive strategy with delayed maturation."><b>Oviparous</b></abbr></p>
                    <p>Neither squid nor octopus, but a unique cephalopod living in the deep ocean's oxygen minimum zones. Despite its scary name, it's harmless and feeds on marine snow.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Habitat</h3>
                    <p>Vampire squids live in extreme deep-sea environments at 2,000-3,000 feet where oxygen levels are too low for most animals. They thrive in these "dead zones."</p>
                    
                    <h3>Unique Adaptations</h3>
                    <p>They have the lowest metabolic rate of any cephalopod and can survive in oxygen levels that would kill other animals. Their red eyes and dark coloration give them their vampire-like appearance.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Defense Mechanisms</h3>
                    <p>When threatened, vampire squids can turn inside-out, exposing spines and light-producing photophores. They can also eject bioluminescent mucus to confuse predators.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Feeding Strategy</h3>
                    <p>Unlike other cephalopods, vampire squids feed on marine snow (dead organic material falling from above) using sticky filaments, making them detritivores rather than predators.</p>

                    <p>Reproduction Type: <abbr title="Females die after laying eggs and guarding them."><b>Oviparous</b></abbr></p>
                    <p>Master of disguise that can imitate the appearance and behavior of over 15 different marine species including flatfish, lionfish, and stingrays. Discovered only in 1998.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Habitat</h3>
                    <p>Found in shallow waters of the Indo-Pacific, particularly around river mouths and estuaries with sandy or muddy bottoms that provide good camouflage opportunities.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Mimicry Abilities</h3>
                    <p>The mimic octopus can change its skin color, pattern, and texture while contorting its body to resemble flatfish, sole, lionfish, mantis shrimp, stingrays, and even sea snakes.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Behavioral Mimicry</h3>
                    <p>Beyond appearance, they mimic the movement patterns of other animals - undulating like a flatfish, spreading arms like a lionfish's fins, or gliding like a stingray.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Intelligence and Learning</h3>
                    <p>Their mimicry shows remarkable intelligence as they choose which animal to mimic based on the threat they face, demonstrating complex decision-making abilities.</p>

                    <p>Scientific Name: <b>Argonauta genus</b></p>
                    <p>Reproduction Type: <abbr title="Females create shells to protect their eggs."><b>Oviparous</b></abbr></p>
                    <p>Pelagic octopuses where females create beautiful, paper-thin shells for egg protection and buoyancy control. Males are tiny and don't have shells.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Habitat</h3>
                    <p>Argonauts live in open ocean waters worldwide, floating near the surface in tropical and subtropical seas. They're truly pelagic, rarely coming near shore.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Sexual Dimorphism</h3>
                    <p>Extreme size difference exists between sexes - females can be 10 inches long while males are only 0.8 inches. Only females produce the characteristic shell.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Shell Function</h3>
                    <p>The shell isn't attached to the female's body but is held by specialized arms. It serves as a brood chamber for eggs and helps control buoyancy by trapping air.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Reproduction Strategy</h3>
                    <p>Males have a specialized arm that detaches and swims to females to deliver sperm packets. The male often dies after this process, while females tend their eggs in their shells.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Historical Significance</h3>
                    <p>Their shells have been prized by collectors for centuries and were often mistakenly thought to belong to a type of nautilus, hence the name "paper nautilus."</p>
