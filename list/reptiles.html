        <p class="par">
          Reptiles are cold-blooded vertebrates that have scales or scutes covering their skin. 
          They breathe air through lungs and most lay eggs on land, though some give birth to live young. 
          Reptiles include snakes, lizards, turtles, crocodiles, and alligators. They are ectothermic, 
          meaning they rely on external heat sources to regulate their body temperature. Reptiles have 
          adapted to live in various environments including deserts, forests, oceans, and freshwater 
          habitats. Many reptiles are excellent predators with specialized hunting techniques.

              <h2>Iguana</h2>
              <img src="list_image/green-iguana2.jpg" alt="Iguana" />
                <p>Scientific Name: <b>Iguana iguana</b></p>
              <p>Reproduction  Type :<abbr title="They lay eggs."><b>Oviparous</b></abbr></p>
              <p>Iguanas are large, herbivorous lizards that are native to Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean.<br/>
                 They are known for their distinctive appearance, with a long tail, spiny crest along their back, and a dewlap (a flap of skin under the chin). <br/>
                 Iguanas are primarily arboreal, meaning they spend most of their time in trees, but they can also be found on the ground.<br/>
                  They are social animals that often live in groups and communicate through body language and vocalizations.</p>
              <h3>Species of Iguana</h3>  
              <p>There are several species of iguanas, including:<br/>
                1.<abbr title="Green Iguana (Iguana iguana)"><b>Green Iguana</b></abbr> ‚Äì the most common and widely recognized species<br />
                2. Lesser Antillean Iguana (Iguana delicatissima)<br/>
                3. Gal√°pagos Land Iguana (Conolophus subcristatus)<br/>
                4. Marine Iguana (Amblyrhynchus cristatus)<br/>
                5. Black Spiny-tailed Iguana (Ctenosaura pectinata)<br/>
                The Green Iguana is the most well-known and commonly kept as a pet.
              </p>
              <h3>Habitat</h3>
              <p>
                Iguanas inhabit a variety of environments, including:<br/>
                Tropical rainforests<br/>
                Dry forests<br/>
                Coastal areas<br/>
                They prefer areas with plenty of vegetation for food and shelter, as well as access to water sources. Iguanas are excellent climbers and often seek refuge in trees to escape predators.
              </p>
              <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
              <p>
                Iguanas are large lizards that can grow up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) in length, although most species are smaller. They have a long, whip-like tail that can be used for balance and defense. Their skin is covered in scales, which can vary in color from green to brown or gray, depending on the species. Iguanas have sharp claws for climbing and strong jaws with flat teeth adapted for grinding plant material.   
              </p>
              <h3>Feeding Habits</h3> 
              <p>
                Iguanas are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a diet of:<br/>
                Leaves<br/>
                Flowers<br/>
                Fruits<br/>
                They have a specialized digestive system that allows them to break down tough plant material. Some species may also consume small insects or animal matter on occasion, but their diet is predominantly plant-based.
              </p>
              <h3>Behavior and Movement</h3>
              <p>
                Iguanas are generally diurnal, meaning they are active during the day. <br/>
                They are known for their slow, deliberate movements and can often be seen basking in the sun to regulate their body temperature. <br/>
                Iguanas are territorial and may display aggressive behavior towards other iguanas, especially during mating season. <br/>
                They communicate through body language, such as head bobbing and tail waving, and can also produce hissing sounds when threatened.
              </p>
              <h3>Breeding and Parenting</h3>
              <p>
                Iguanas are oviparous, meaning they lay eggs rather than giving birth to live young.<br/>
                 During the breeding season, females dig burrows in sandy or soft soil to lay their eggs‚Äîusually between 20 and 70, depending on the species.<br/>
                  After laying, the female covers the eggs and leaves; there is no parental care, and the eggs incubate for about 65‚Äì90 days, relying on environmental warmth. <br/>
                  Once hatched, baby iguanas are fully independent and must find food and avoid predators on their own.<br/>
                   This lack of parental involvement is similar to many reptiles and some bird species, where young are self-sufficient from birth.

                <h3>Niche and Ecological Role</h3>
                <p>
                  Iguanas play an important role in their ecosystems as herbivores and seed dispersers.<br/>
                   By feeding on a variety of plants, they help control vegetation growth and contribute to the cycling of nutrients.<br/>
                    Their droppings often contain seeds, which can germinate and grow into new plants, aiding in forest regeneration.<br/>
                     Iguanas also serve as prey for larger predators, such as birds of prey, snakes, and mammals, making them a vital part of the food web.
                </p>
                <h3>Niche Facts and Fascinating Details</h3>
                <p>
                  Iguanas have a third "parietal" eye on the top of their head, which is sensitive to changes in light and helps them detect predators from above.<br/>
                   They are excellent swimmers and can hold their breath underwater for up to 30 minutes.<br/>
                   Some iguana species can change color to regulate their body temperature or communicate with other iguanas.<br/>
                    In captivity, iguanas can live up to 20 years with proper care.<br/>
                     Their ability to regenerate lost tails is a defense mechanism against predators, allowing them to escape while the predator is distracted by the detached tail.

              </p>
              <h3>Habitat</h3>
              <p>
                Chameleons inhabit a variety of environments, including:<br/>
                Tropical rainforests<br/>
                Dry savannas<br/>
                Scrublands<br/>
                They prefer areas with plenty of vegetation for camouflage and hunting. Chameleons are primarily arboreal, spending most of their time in trees and shrubs.
              </p>
              <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
              <p>
                Chameleons are known for their distinctive features, including:<br/>
                Long, prehensile tails that help them balance and grip branches<br/>
                Zygodactylous feet with two toes pointing forward and two backward, allowing them to grasp branches securely<br/>
                Independent eye movement, enabling them to look in different directions simultaneously<br/>
                A long, sticky tongue that can extend up to twice their body length to catch prey<br/>
                Their skin contains specialized cells called chromatophores that allow them to change color for communication and camouflage.
              </p>
              <h3>Feeding Habits</h3>
              <p>
                Chameleons are primarily insectivorous, feeding on a diet of:<br/>
                Insects (crickets, locusts, flies)<br/>
                Small invertebrates<br/>
                Some larger species may also consume small vertebrates like lizards or birds.<br/>
                They use their long tongues to catch prey with remarkable speed and accuracy. Chameleons have excellent vision, allowing them to spot prey from a distance.
              </p>
              <h3>Behavior and Movement</h3>
              <p>
                Chameleons are generally solitary and territorial animals. They are known for their slow, deliberate movements, which help them avoid detection by predators.<br/>
                Their ability to change color is not only for camouflage but also for communication, temperature regulation, and expressing mood.<br/>
                Chameleons can move their eyes independently, allowing them to scan their surroundings for threats while keeping their body still.
              </p>
              <h3>Breeding and Parenting</h3>
              <p>
                Chameleons are oviparous, meaning they lay eggs rather than giving birth to live young.<br/>
                During the breeding season, female chameleons dig holes in the soil to lay their eggs‚Äîtypically between 10 and 40, depending on the species.<br/>
                 After laying, the female covers the eggs and leaves; there is no parental care. <br/>
                 The eggs incubate for 4‚Äì12 months, depending on the species and environmental conditions.<br/>
                  Once hatched, baby chameleons are fully independent and must find food and avoid predators on their own.<br/>
                   This lack of parental involvement is common among reptiles, where young are self-sufficient from birth.
                <h3>Niche and Ecological Role</h3>
                <p>
                  Chameleons play a unique role in their ecosystems as both predators and prey.<br/>
                  By feeding on insects and small invertebrates, they help control pest populations and maintain ecological balance.<br/>
                  Their presence supports biodiversity, and they serve as food for birds, snakes, and mammals.<br/>
                  Chameleons also contribute to the pollination of some plants when they feed on nectar or insects found on flowers.
                </p>
                <h3>Niche Facts and Fascinating Details</h3>
                <p>
                  Chameleons are famous for their color-changing ability, which is used for communication, camouflage, and temperature regulation.<br/>
                  Their eyes can rotate and focus independently, giving them a 360-degree field of vision.<br/>
                  Some species can project their tongues at speeds up to 13 miles per hour to catch prey.<br/>
                  Chameleons are sensitive to environmental changes and habitat loss, making them vulnerable to extinction in some regions.<br/>
                  In captivity, chameleons require specialized care, including controlled humidity, temperature, and UV lighting to thrive.

                They have soft, scaly skin that can vary in texture and color depending on the species.<br/>
                Geckos are known for their unique toe pads, which allow them to climb smooth surfaces and even walk on ceilings.<br/>
                Their eyes are large and often lack eyelids, so they use a protective membrane to keep their eyes moist.
              </p>
              <h3>Feeding Habits</h3>
              <p>
                Geckos are primarily insectivorous, feeding on a diet of:<br/>
                Insects (crickets, moths, beetles)<br/>
                Small invertebrates<br/>
                Some larger species may also consume small vertebrates like lizards or frogs.<br/>
                Geckos have a unique feeding mechanism, using their long, sticky tongues to catch prey quickly and efficiently.
              </p>
              <h3>Behavior and Movement</h3>
              <p>
                Geckos are generally nocturnal, meaning they are most active at night.<br/>

                Geckos have excellent climbing abilities due to their specialized toe pads, allowing them to navigate vertical surfaces with ease.<br/>
                They are also capable of dropping their tails as a defense mechanism, allowing them to escape predators while the detached tail distracts the threat.
              </p>
              <h3>Breeding and Parenting</h3>
              <p>
                Geckos are oviparous, meaning they lay eggs rather than giving birth to live young.<br/>
                During the breeding season, female geckos lay eggs in hidden, protected locations such as under rocks, logs, or within crevices..<br/>
                 Most gecko species lay one or two eggs per clutch, and may produce several clutches during a breeding season. The eggs are typically soft-shelled when laid but harden soon after exposure to air..<br/>
                  Geckos do not provide parental care; after laying, the eggs are left to incubate on their own. Incubation periods vary by species and environmental conditions, usually lasting from several weeks to a few months..<br/>
                   Hatchlings are independent from birth and must find food and shelter immediately.

              </p>
              <h3>Breeding and Parenting</h3>
              <p>
                Monitor lizards are oviparous, meaning they lay eggs rather than giving birth to live young.<br/>
                During the breeding season, females will lay clutches of eggs in burrows or hidden locations.<br/>
                The eggs are left to incubate and hatch on their own, with no parental care provided after laying.
                Incubation periods vary by species, usually lasting from several weeks to a few months.<br/>
                Hatchlings are independent from birth and must find food and shelter immediately.
                <h3>Niche and Ecological Role</h3>
                <p>
                  Monitor lizards play an important role in their ecosystems as apex predators, helping to control populations of small mammals, birds, and reptiles.<br/>

              <h3>Habitat</h3>
              <p>
                Pythons inhabit a variety of environments, including:<br/>
                Tropical rainforests<br/>
                Savannas<br/>
                Grasslands<br/>
                They are adaptable creatures that can thrive in both natural and human-made habitats. Pythons are primarily terrestrial but some species are arboreal or semi-aquatic.
              </p>
              <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
              <p>
                Pythons are characterized by their large, muscular bodies and distinctive patterns on their scales.<br/>
                They have smooth, shiny scales that can vary in color from brown and gray to vibrant greens and yellows, depending on the species.<br/>
                Pythons typically have elongated heads with sharp teeth and a keen sense of smell, which they use to locate prey.<br/>
                Their tails are long and muscular, aiding in balance and defense.
              </p>
              <h3>Feeding Habits</h3>
              <p>
                Pythons are carnivorous constrictor snakes, feeding on a diet of:<br/>
                Small mammals (rodents, rabbits)<br/>
                Birds<br/>
                Reptiles (lizards, smaller snakes)<br/>
                Pythons use their powerful bodies to constrict prey, wrapping around it and squeezing until
                the prey suffocates. They can consume prey larger than their own diameter, thanks to their flexible jaws and expandable bodies.
              </p>
              <h3>Behavior and Movement</h3>
              <p>
                Pythons are generally nocturnal, meaning they are most active at night.<br/>
                They are known for their slow, deliberate movements, often remaining motionless for long periods while waiting for prey.<br/>
                Pythons can be territorial and may display aggressive behavior towards other pythons, especially during mating season.<br/>
                They are capable swimmers and can hold their breath underwater for extended periods.
              </p>
              <h3>Breeding and Parenting</h3>
              <p>
                Pythons are oviparous, meaning they lay eggs rather than giving birth to live young.<br/>
                During the breeding season, female pythons will seek out a suitable mate and engage in courtship behaviors. After mating, the female will lay a clutch of eggs, which she will incubate by coiling around them and using her body heat to keep them warm. Once the eggs hatch, the young pythons are independent and must fend for themselves.
                Incubation periods vary by species, usually lasting from several weeks to a few months.<br/>
                Hatchlings are independent from birth and must find food and shelter immediately.
                <h3>Niche and Ecological Role</h3>
                <p>
                  Pythons play an important role in their ecosystems as apex predators, helping to control populations of small mammals, birds, and reptiles.<br/>
                  Their presence supports biodiversity and contributes to the balance of food webs in their habitats.<br/>
                  Pythons also serve as prey for larger predators, including birds of prey and large mammals.
                </p>
              <h3>Niche Facts and Fascinating Details</h3>
              <p>
                Pythons are known for their impressive size, with some species growing over 20 feet (6 meters) in length.<br/>
                They have a unique method of locomotion called "rectilinear movement," where they move in a straight line by contracting and expanding their muscles.<br/>
                Pythons can go for long periods without food, sometimes surviving several months between meals.<br/>
                In some cultures, pythons are considered symbols of strength and power, and they play a role in local folklore.<br/>
                Pythons are popular in the exotic pet trade, but they require specialized care and large enclosures to thrive.

              <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
              <p>
                Kingsnakes are characterized by their slender bodies, smooth scales, and distinctive patterns.<br/>
                They have a wide range of colors, including black, brown, yellow, and white, often arranged in bands or stripes.<br/>
                Kingsnakes typically have elongated heads with small eyes and a keen sense of smell, which they use to locate prey.<br/>
                Their tails are long and flexible, aiding in balance and defense.
              </p>
              <h3>Feeding Habits</h3>
              <p>
                Kingsnakes are carnivorous constrictor snakes, feeding on a diet of:<br/>
                Small mammals (rodents, rabbits)<br/>
                Birds<br/>
                Other snakes (including venomous species)<br/>
                Kingsnakes are known for their ability to consume other snakes, including rattlesnakes and copperheads, making them valuable for controlling snake populations. They use their powerful bodies to constrict prey, wrapping around it and squeezing until the prey suffocates.
              </p>
              <h3>Behavior and Movement</h3>
              <p>
                Kingsnakes are generally diurnal, meaning they are most active during the day.<br/>
                They are known for their quick movements and agility, allowing them to escape predators quickly.<br/>
                Kingsnakes can be territorial and may display aggressive behavior towards other kingsnakes, especially during mating season.<br/>
                They are capable swimmers and can hold their breath underwater for extended periods.
              </p>
              <h3>Breeding and Parenting</h3>
              <p>
                Kingsnakes are oviparous, meaning they lay eggs rather than giving birth to live young.<br/>
                During the breeding season, females lay clutches of 6 to 24 eggs in hidden locations, such as under rocks or in leaf litter. The eggs are leathery and require warm, humid conditions to incubate. After about 60 to 70 days, the eggs hatch, and the young snakes emerge fully formed and ready to fend for themselves.
                Incubation periods vary by species, usually lasting from several weeks to a few months.<br/>
                Hatchlings are independent from birth and must find food and shelter immediately.
                <h3>Niche and Ecological Role</h3>
                <p>
                  Kingsnakes play an important role in their ecosystems as both predators and prey.<br/>
                  They help control populations of small mammals, birds, and other snakes, including venomous species.<br/>
                  Their presence supports biodiversity and contributes to the balance of food webs in their habitats.<br/>
                  Kingsnakes also serve as prey for larger predators, including birds of prey and mammals.

              <h3>Niche Facts and Fascinating Details</h3>
              <p>
                Kingsnakes are known for their striking coloration and patterns, which can vary widely between species.<br/>
                They have a unique method of locomotion called "rectilinear movement," where they move in a straight line by contracting and expanding their muscles.<br/>
                Kingsnakes can go for long periods without food, sometimes surviving several months between meals.<br/>
                In some cultures, kingsnakes are considered symbols of protection and good luck, and they play a role in local folklore.<br/>
                Kingsnakes are popular in the exotic pet trade due to their docile nature and striking appearance.

          <p>
            Mambas inhabit a variety of environments, including:<br/>
            Forests<br/>
            Savannas<br/>
            Scrublands<br/>
            They are adaptable creatures that can thrive in both natural and human-made habitats. Mambas are primarily terrestrial but can also be found in trees.
          </p>
          <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>

          <p>
            Mambas are characterized by their slender bodies, smooth scales, and distinctive coloration.<br/>
            They have a range of colors, including black, green, and yellow, depending on the species.<br/>
            Mambas typically have elongated heads with large eyes and a keen sense of smell, which they use to locate prey.<br/>
            Their tails are long and flexible, aiding in balance and defense. 
          </p>
          <h3>Feeding Habits</h3>
          <p>
            Mambas are carnivorous and primarily feed on a diet of:<br/>
            Small mammals (rodents, birds)<br/>
            Other reptiles<br/>
            Mambas are highly venomous and use their potent venom to subdue prey. They strike quickly, injecting venom through their long fangs, which immobilizes the prey before consumption.

          </p>
          <h3>Behavior and Movement</h3>
          <p>
            Mambas are known for their agility and speed. They are primarily arboreal, spending much of their time in trees, but they are also excellent swimmers. Mambas are diurnal, meaning they are active during the day. They use their keen eyesight and sense of smell to locate prey and avoid predators.
          </p>
          <h3>Breeding and Parenting</h3>
          <p>
            Mambas are oviparous, meaning they lay eggs rather than giving birth to live young.<br/>
            During the breeding season, female mambas will lay a clutch of eggs in a hidden location, such as a burrow or under a pile of leaves. The eggs are left to incubate on their own, and the young mambas emerge fully formed and ready to fend for themselves.

          </p>
          <h3>Niche and Ecological Role</h3>
          <p>
            Mambas play an important role in their ecosystems as apex predators, helping to control populations of small mammals and other reptiles.<br/>
            Their presence supports biodiversity and contributes to the balance of food webs in their habitats.<br/>
            Mambas also serve as prey for larger predators, including birds of prey and mammals.
          </p>
          <h3>Niche Facts and Fascinating Details</h3>

                <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
                <p>
                  Poison Dart Frogs have smooth, moist skin that can vary in color from bright blue to yellow, red, or green.<br>
                  They are small, typically measuring around 1‚Äì2 inches (2.5‚Äì5 cm) in length.<br>
                  Their skin contains potent alkaloid toxins, which can be harmful or even lethal to predators.
                </p>
                <h3>Behavior and Movement</h3>
                <p>
                  These frogs are primarily diurnal, meaning they are most active during the day.<br>
                  They are known for their unique mating calls, which can be heard during the breeding season.<br>
                  Poison Dart Frogs are agile climbers and can leap impressive distances between branches.
                </p>
                <h3>Habitat</h3>
                <p>
                  Poison Dart Frogs inhabit the humid understory of tropical rainforests, preferring areas with dense vegetation.<br>
                  They are often found near streams or ponds, where they breed and lay eggs.
                </p>
                <h3>Feeding Habits</h3>
                <p>
                  Poison Dart Frogs are insectivorous, primarily feeding on small insects and other invertebrates.<br>
                  They use their long tongues to catch prey quickly and efficiently.
                </p>
                <h3>Breeding and Parenting</h3>
                <p>
                  During the breeding season, male Poison Dart Frogs call to attract females. Once a female selects a mate, they engage in amplexus, a mating position where the male grasps the female. The female then lays her eggs on leaves above water, and the male fertilizes them. After the eggs hatch, the male often carries the tadpoles on his back to a suitable water source.
                </p>
                <h3>Niche and Ecological Role</h3>
                <p>
                  Poison Dart Frogs play an important role in their ecosystem as predators of small insects, helping to control their populations.<br>
                  Their bright coloration serves as a warning to potential predators about their toxicity, which is a form of aposematism.
                </p>
                <h3>Fascinating Facts</h3>
                <p>
                  Poison Dart Frogs are named for the indigenous people of South America, who used their skin toxins to poison the tips of blow darts for hunting.<br>
                  The toxicity of these frogs varies by species and is influenced by their diet, which includes specific ants and other invertebrates.<br>
                  Some species of Poison Dart Frogs are kept as pets, but they lose their toxicity in captivity due to a lack of their natural diet.<br>
                  They can live up to 10 years in the wild and are known for their complex social behaviors during mating.<br>
                  Poison Dart Frogs are also known for their unique parental care, with males often carrying the tadpoles on their backs to water sources.

              Often shelters under logs, stones, or in burrows during the day.
              </p>
              <h3>Feeding Habits</h3>
              <p>
              Eats insects, worms, spiders, slugs, and other small invertebrates.<br>
              Hunts mainly at night using a sit-and-wait strategy, catching prey with a sticky tongue.<br>
              Plays an important role in controlling pest populations in gardens and agricultural areas.
              </p>
              <h3>Behavior and Movement</h3>
              <p>
              Moves with a slow, deliberate walk or short hops rather than long jumps.<br>
              Nocturnal and spends the day hidden in cool, damp places.<br>
              Migrates to breeding ponds in spring, sometimes traveling long distances.<br>
              Can remain dormant during cold or dry periods by burrowing underground.
              </p>
              <h3>Breeding and Parenting</h3>
              <p>
              Breeds in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams in early spring.<br>
              Females lay long strings of eggs (spawn) in water, which hatch into tadpoles.<br>
              Tadpoles undergo metamorphosis into juvenile toads over several weeks.<br>
              No parental care after eggs are laid; juveniles are independent from birth.
              </p>
              <h3>Niche and Ecological Role</h3>
              <p>
              Important predator of garden and crop pests.<br>

              Their presence indicates a healthy, balanced ecosystem.<br>
              Toads help aerate soil through their burrowing behavior.
              </p>
              <h3>Fascinating Facts</h3>
              <p>
              Common Toads migrate to water bodies in spring to breed, often returning to the same pond each year.<br>
              They can live up to 40 years in the wild.<br>
              Produce a mild toxin from their skin that deters many predators.<br>
              Can play dead or puff up their bodies when threatened.<br>
              Important for controlling garden pests such as slugs and insects.<br>
              Their warty skin is not contagious and does not cause warts in humans.<br>
              Toads have been featured in folklore and literature for centuries.

              <h2>Surinam Toad</h2>
              <img src="list_image/surinam.jpg" alt="Surinam Toad"/>
              <p>Scientific Name: <b>Pipa pipa</b></p>
              <p>Reproduction Type: <abbr data-tooltip="They lay eggs."><b>Oviparous</b></abbr></p>
              <p>The Surinam Toad is an aquatic toad native to South America, famous for its flat, leaf-like body and unique reproductive method.</p>
              <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
              <p>
              Flattened, brownish body, small eyes, and webbed feet.<br>
              Adults can reach up to 8 inches (20 cm) in length.<br>
              Their skin is rough and covered in small, star-shaped sensory organs.
              </p>
              <h3>Habitat</h3>
              <p>
              Inhabits slow-moving rivers, ponds, and swamps in tropical rainforests.<br>
              Prefers muddy bottoms with plenty of leaf litter for camouflage.<br>
              Found in countries such as Brazil, Suriname, Guyana, and Peru.
              </p>
              <h3>Feeding Habits</h3>
              <p>
              Carnivorous; feeds on small fish, worms, and aquatic invertebrates.<br>
              Uses a suction feeding method by rapidly opening its mouth to draw in prey.<br>
              Lacks a tongue, so it relies on its forelimbs to help manipulate food.
              </p>
              <h3>Behavior and Movement</h3>
              <p>
              Surinam Toads are fully aquatic and rarely leave the water.<br>
              They are mostly nocturnal and remain motionless during the day.<br>
              Their webbed feet aid in swimming and digging into the substrate.
              </p>
              <h3>Breeding and Parenting</h3>
              <p>
              Mating involves an elaborate underwater "somersault" where the male fertilizes the eggs and presses them onto the female's back.<br>
              The skin on the female's back swells and forms pockets, where the eggs are embedded.<br>
              Tadpoles develop inside these pockets and emerge as fully formed toadlets after several weeks.<br>
              This unique brooding method provides protection from predators and environmental hazards.
              </p>
              <h3>Niche and Ecological Role</h3>
              <p>
              Surinam Toads help control populations of aquatic invertebrates and small fish.<br>
              Their presence indicates healthy, unpolluted freshwater habitats.<br>
              They serve as prey for larger fish, birds, and mammals.
              </p>
              <h3>Fascinating Facts</h3>
              <p>
              Females carry fertilized eggs embedded in the skin of their backs, where the young develop and emerge as fully formed toadlets.<br>
              Surinam Toads have no tongue or teeth and use their hands to shovel food into their mouths.<br>
              Their unique reproductive method is one of the most unusual among amphibians.<br>
              They can remain motionless for long periods, camouflaged among leaf litter in the water.<br>
              Their star-shaped sensory organs help detect vibrations and movement in the water.<br>
              The Surinam Toad can live up to 8 years in the wild.<br>
