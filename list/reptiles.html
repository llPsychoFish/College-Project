        <p class="par">
          Reptiles are cold-blooded vertebrates that have scales or scutes covering their skin. 
          They breathe air through lungs and most lay eggs on land, though some give birth to live young. 
          Reptiles include snakes, lizards, turtles, crocodiles, and alligators. They are ectothermic, 
          meaning they rely on external heat sources to regulate their body temperature. Reptiles have 
          adapted to live in various environments including deserts, forests, oceans, and freshwater 
          habitats. Many reptiles are excellent predators with specialized hunting techniques.

                <img src="list_image/dingo.jpg" alt="Dingo" />

                <p>
                  The dingo is one of Australia's most unique wild animals. Though it
                  resembles a domestic dog, it is a separate species that has lived in the
                  wild for thousands of years. Adaptable and intelligent, the dingo plays
                  a crucial role in Australia's ecosystems but also creates tension with
                  farmers. This essay explores the dingo‚Äôs appearance, habitat, diet,
                  behavior, role in the ecosystem, human interaction, and includes some
                  fascinating facts about this remarkable animal.
                </p>
                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>
                  Dingoes have a sleek, athletic build ideal for running and hunting.
                  Their fur is usually golden-yellow, but can also be reddish, black, or
                  white. They have upright ears, almond-shaped eyes, and a bushy tail.
                  Adult dingoes typically weigh between 13 to 24 kilograms and stand about
                  50 to 60 centimeters tall at the shoulder
                </p>
                <h3>Habitat</h3>
                <p>
                  Dingoes are incredibly adaptable and live in deserts, grasslands,
                  tropical forests, and even alpine areas. They are especially common in
                  central and northern Australia but are less common in the southern
                  regions due to farming and fencing.
                </p>
                <h3>Diet</h3>
                <p>
                  Dingoes are skilled hunters and feed on a wide variety of animals. Their
                  diet includes rabbits, birds, reptiles, rodents, and sometimes larger
                  prey like kangaroos and wallabies. They also scavenge food when
                  necessary.
                </p>
                <h3>Behavior and Social Structure</h3>
                <p>
                  Dingoes are intelligent, social animals. They may live alone, in pairs,
                  or in packs. In a pack, only the dominant male and female usually breed,
                  while the others help care for the pups. They communicate through
                  howling, scent marking, and body language.
                </p>
                <h3>Role in the Ecosystem</h3>
                <p>
                  Dingoes play the role of apex predator in many Australian ecosystems.
                  They help control populations of rabbits, wallabies, and feral animals
                  like foxes and cats, which can threaten native species.
                </p>
                <h3>Interaction with Humans</h3>
                <p>
                  While dingoes help maintain ecological balance, they are often in
                  conflict with farmers, especially in sheep-farming areas. To protect
                  livestock, farmers have used fences, traps, and poison baits. However,
                  conservationists argue that dingoes should be protected due to their
                  ecological importance.
                </p>
                <h3>Interesting Facts</h3>
                <p>
                  Dingoes are believed to be the oldest breed of dog still living in the
                  wild, having arrived in Australia over 4,000 years ago‚Äîlong before
                  European settlers.<br/>
                  Studies show that where dingoes thrive, smaller predators like foxes and
                  feral cats are less common‚Äîthis effect is known as
                  <b>"mesopredator suppression"</b> and helps protect native wildlife.<br />
                  Dingoes do not bark as much as domestic dogs. Instead, they howl‚Äîoften
                  in a rising and falling tone‚Äîwhich can carry long distances through the
                  bush.<br/>
                  In some areas, dingoes have been seen cooperating with wedge-tailed
                  eagles by circling prey, making it easier for both the bird and the
                  dingo to hunt successfully.<br />
                  One of the longest man-made structures in the world, the Dingo Fence,
                  stretches over 5,600 kilometers across Australia. It was built to keep
                  dingoes out of southeastern farmlands.

        <h1>Amphibians</h1>
        <p class="par">
          Amphibians are cold-blooded vertebrates that typically live part of their lives in water 
          and part on land. They have smooth, moist skin without scales and usually undergo 
          metamorphosis from aquatic larvae to terrestrial adults. Amphibians include frogs, toads, 
          salamanders, and newts. They breathe through their skin, lungs, and sometimes gills during 
          their larval stage. Most amphibians lay their eggs in water or moist environments, and their 
          permeable skin makes them sensitive to environmental changes and pollution.

            <p>Type :<abbr title="Non-raptor birds are a diverse group that feed on seeds, fruits,fish, insects, or nectar"><b>Non-raptor</b></abbr></p>
            <p>The cassowary is one of the most remarkable birds walking the Earth today. With its dinosaur-like appearance, vibrant coloring, and reputation as one of the most dangerous birds in the world, the cassowary is as fascinating as it is fearsome. Native to the tropical forests of northern Australia, New Guinea, and surrounding islands, this flightless bird plays a vital role in its ecosystem‚Äîand commands respect from anyone who crosses its path.</p>
            <h3>Species of Cassowary</h3>
            <p>There are three species of cassowary:<br/>
              1.<abbr title="pictured above"><b>Sourthern Cassowary (Casuarius casuarius)</b></abbr>‚Äì the most well-known and widely studied<br />
              2. Northern Cassowary (Casuarius unappendiculatus)<br/>
              3. Dwarf Cassowary (Casuarius bennetti)<br/>
              The Southern Cassowary is the largest and most iconic, often referred
              to when people mention ‚Äúthe cassowary.‚Äù
            </p>
            <h3>Habitat</h3>
            <p>
              Cassowaries inhabit dense tropical rainforests, swamps, and mangroves
              in northern Australia, New Guinea, and nearby islands. They prefer
              areas with thick vegetation that provides cover and abundant food
              sources. These birds are solitary and territorial, often establishing
              large home ranges that they defend from other cassowaries. Their
              primary range includes:<br/>
              Northern Queensland, Australia+<br/>
              New Guinea and surrounding islands<br/>
              Parts of Indonesia<br/>
              They rely on thick vegetation and ample fruit supplies, as they are
              mostly forest dwellers, using their powerful legs to move through the
              underbrush and escape danger.
            </p>
            <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
            <p>
              The cassowary looks like something out of prehistory:<br />
              It can grow up to 6.6 feet (2 meters) tall and weigh over 130 pounds
              (60 kg). It has coarse black feathers that resemble hair. Its head and
              neck are brightly colored in blue, red, and purple, with color
              intensity increasing during mating season. On top of its head sits a
              casque‚Äîa helmet-like structure made of keratin and bone, whose exact
              function is still debated. It may help with sound amplification, head
              protection, or moving through dense vegetation. But the most iconic
              (and dangerous) part of the cassowary is its feet: each has three
              toes, and the inner toe sports a dagger-like claw up to 5 inches (12
              cm) long‚Äîcapable of inflicting serious injuries.
            </p>
            <h3>Feeding Habits</h3>
            <p>
              Cassowaries are omnivorous, but their diet is largely frugivorous
              (fruit-based). They consume:<br />
              A wide variety of fallen tropical fruits<br />
              Fungi, insects, small animals, and even dead mammals if necessary<br />
              Their strong beaks and digestive systems allow them to eat toxic or
              tough fruits that other animals cannot. Remarkably, cassowaries play a
              crucial ecological role as seed dispersers. Many rainforest plants
              rely on cassowaries to eat their fruit and deposit the seeds‚Äîoften far
              away, complete with natural fertilizer from their droppings.
            </p>
            <h3>Behavior and Movement</h3>
            <p>
              They are:<br/>
              Excellent runners, capable of reaching 50 km/h (31 mph) through dense
              jungle<br/>
              Strong swimmers, often crossing rivers and even swimming in the
              ocean<br/>
              Silent movers, but they can produce deep booming sounds, which may
              help them communicate through thick forests<br/>
              Despite their shy nature, when threatened‚Äîespecially if cornered or
              protecting eggs‚Äîthey can become extremely aggressive. There have been
              recorded attacks on humans, sometimes causing serious injuries or, rarely, death.
            </p>
            <h3>Breeding and Parenting</h3>
            <p>
              Cassowary reproduction is as fascinating as the bird itself. In a
              reversal of typical bird parenting roles:<br/>
              Females are larger, more colorful, and dominant. After mating, the
              female lays 3‚Äì6 large, green eggs in a shallow ground nest. She then
              leaves‚Äîand the male takes full responsibility, the male incubates the
              eggs for about 50 days, and then raises the chicks for up to 9 months.
              During this time, he defends them fiercely, teaches them how to find
              food, and ensures they survive in the wild jungle environment.
            </p>
            <h3>Niche and Ecological Role</h3>
            <p>
              Cassowaries are known as ‚Äúkeystone species‚Äù because of their crucial
              role in seed dispersal. Some rainforest trees and plants depend
              entirely on cassowaries to reproduce. Without them, these ecosystems
              would collapse. Cassowaries also help shape the forest structure
              by:<br/>
              Spreading large seeds over great distances, enabling rare or
              endangered trees to survive Because they can consume over 150
              different types of fruit, they‚Äôre sometimes called the gardeners of the rainforest.
            </p>
            <h3>Niche Facts and Fascinating Details</h3>
            <p>
              The cassowary casque continues growing throughout its life and may
              help age or identify individuals. Cassowaries cannot fly, but their
              strong legs make them powerful runners and jumpers. The cassowary‚Äôs
              call‚Äîa deep, low-frequency "boom"‚Äîis one of the lowest-pitched bird
              calls in the world, possibly used for long-distance communication in
              dense forests. In Aboriginal culture, cassowaries are respected and
              sometimes feared‚Äîappearing in stories and myths as guardians of the
              forest. Despite their size, they are masters of camouflage in the
              underbrush, often going unnoticed even when nearby. 
              Cassowaries are listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss, hunting,
              and vehicle collisions. Conservation efforts focus on protecting their
              habitats and educating local communities about their ecological
              importance. The cassowary is the only bird in the world with a
              "helmet" on its head, which is made of keratin (the same material as
              human nails) and can grow up to 18 inches (45 cm) tall. This casque is
              thought to help the bird navigate through dense vegetation and may also
              play a role in attracting mates during the breeding season.
              The cassowary's feet are incredibly powerful, allowing it to run
              through dense forests at speeds of up to 50 km/h (31 mph). Its inner
              toe has a sharp, dagger-like claw that can inflict serious injuries,
              making the cassowary one of the most dangerous birds in the world.
              Despite their fearsome reputation, cassowaries are generally shy and
              prefer to avoid human contact. They are primarily solitary animals,
              although they may form small groups during the breeding season or when
              food is abundant.
              Cassowaries have a unique way of communicating with each other,
              producing deep, booming calls that can be heard over long distances.
              These calls are thought to play a role in attracting mates and
              establishing territory. They are also known to produce a variety of
              other vocalizations, including hisses, grunts, and growls, depending
              on their mood and situation.
              Cassowaries have a relatively long lifespan, living up to 20‚Äì25 years
