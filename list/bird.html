      <h1>Birds</h1>
      <p class="par">
        Birds are warm-blooded vertebrates belonging to the class Aves. They are
        characterized by feathers, beaks without teeth, lightweight skeletons,
        and the ability to lay hard-shelled eggs. Most birds can fly, thanks to
        their strong chest muscles and wings, although some species like
        ostriches, emus, and penguins are flightless. There are over 10,000
        known species of birds found on every continent, from icy Antarctica to
        tropical rainforests. Birds have excellent vision, which helps them
        hunt, navigate, and avoid danger. Many species are known for their
        melodious calls and songs, used for communication and attracting mates.
        Birds play vital roles in the environment. They help pollinate plants,
        disperse seeds, and control insect populations. Some birds, like eagles
        and vultures, are scavengers and help clean up the environment by
        feeding on dead animals. Birds also hold cultural and spiritual
        significance in many societies and are a major focus of birdwatching, a
        popular hobby around the world.
      </p>
      <p class="par">
        Birds are divided into two main groups: non-raptors and raptors. Non-raptor
        birds include species like sparrows, robins, and parrots, which primarily
        feed on seeds, fruits, insects, or nectar. Raptors, such as eagles,
        hawks, and owls, are birds of prey that hunt and feed on other animals.
        They have sharp talons and beaks adapted for catching and tearing flesh.
        Birds are also known for their migratory behavior, with many species
        traveling long distances between breeding and wintering grounds. This
        migration is often triggered by changes in daylight, temperature, and
        food availability. Some birds, like the Arctic Tern, undertake the longest
        migrations of any animal, traveling thousands of miles each year.

        <p>
          The Arctic Tern is a small seabird renowned not for its size, but for
          its extraordinary endurance and adaptability. Known as one of the
          greatest travelers in the animal kingdom, this bird annually performs
          a round-trip migration from the Arctic to the Antarctic, covering tens
          of thousands of kilometers. With elegant white plumage, sharp red
          beaks, and streamlined bodies, Arctic Terns are as beautiful as they
          are biologically fascinating.
        </p>

        <h3>Habitat</h3>
        <p>
          Arctic Terns breed in Arctic and sub-Arctic regions, including
          Greenland, Iceland, Alaska, and northern parts of Canada, Europe, and
          Russia. Their nesting sites are typically coastal tundra, rocky
          islands, and beaches. During the non-breeding season, they fly to the
          Antarctic Circle, spending their time in cold southern oceans, far
          away from human settlements. This extreme migration allows them to
          experience two summers per year, giving them more daylight than any
          other animal on Earth.
        </p>

        <h3>Feeding Habits</h3>
        <p>
          Arctic Terns are carnivorous, feeding mainly on small fish and marine
          invertebrates like shrimp and krill. They forage by hovering above the
          water and diving to catch prey near the surface. Sometimes, they also
          pick insects from land or water, especially during breeding when food
          must be plentiful for their chicks. Their sharp eyesight helps them
          spot fish underwater, and their fast, agile flight aids in quick
          capture.
        </p>

        <h3>Migration</h3>
        <p>
          Every year, the Arctic Tern travels from the Arctic to the Antarctic
          and back again, making a round trip of about 70,000 to 80,000
          kilometers (43,000 to 50,000 miles)‚Äîthe longest known migration in the
          animal kingdom. They follow a zigzag route, catching favorable wind
          currents and stopping at key feeding sites along the way. This journey
          is not only a test of endurance but also a demonstration of how finely
          attuned these birds are to Earth's geography and weather systems.
        </p>

        <h3>Breeding and Life Cycle</h3>
        <p>
          Breeding takes place during the Arctic summer, when daylight is nearly
          continuous. Arctic Terns are monogamous and often return to the same
          breeding grounds‚Äîand even the same mate‚Äîyear after year. They lay 1 to
          3 eggs in shallow ground nests lined with grass and feathers. Both
          parents share in incubation and feeding the chicks.<br />
          Once hatched, the chicks are semi-precocial: they are born with down
          and can walk, but they rely on their parents for food. Fledging occurs
          after about three to four weeks, and not long after, the long
          migration south begins.
        </p>

        <h3>Niche and Ecological Role</h3>
        <p>
          The Arctic Tern plays a key role in the marine ecosystem. As predators
          of small fish and invertebrates, they help control these populations.
          They are also indicators of ocean health; changes in their migration
          patterns or breeding success can reflect shifts in fish populations or
          ocean temperatures due to climate change.<br />
          Moreover, they have few natural predators due to their remote nesting
          locations, though eggs and chicks are vulnerable to foxes, gulls, and
          skuas. Humans pose threats through habitat disturbance, climate
          change, and pollution. Fortunately, they are currently listed as Least
          Concern on the IUCN Red List, though local populations may vary in
          status.
        </p>

        <h3>Facts</h3>
        <p>
          An individual Arctic Tern can fly over 2.5 million kilometers in its
          lifetime‚Äîenough to reach the Moon and back more than three times.<br />
          They have a lifespan of around 30 years, meaning they may see more
          daylight than any other animal.<br />
          During migration, they feed along the way, often stopping in the North
          Atlantic, off the coast of Africa, or near New Zealand, depending on
          the route.<br />
          Despite their graceful appearance, they are highly aggressive around
          their nests and will dive-bomb humans and predators alike.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Arctic Tern's migration is so extensive that it has been observed
          to fly over 100,000 kilometers (62,000 miles) in a single year,
          experiencing both the Arctic and Antarctic summers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their name comes from the Old Norse word "terna," meaning "tern," and
          they are closely related to other terns, gulls, and skuas.

          The Blue-footed Booby is one of the most iconic seabirds in the world,
          instantly recognizable by its bright turquoise-blue feet and comical
          behavior. Native to the eastern Pacific coastline, this bird combines
          beauty, skill, and quirkiness, making it a favorite among wildlife
          watchers and scientists alike. Behind its playful appearance lies a
          bird perfectly adapted to life at sea and a fascinating case of
          natural selection and mate choice.
        </p>

        <h3>Habitat and Distribution</h3>
        <p>
          The Blue-footed Booby is mainly found along the coastal regions of the
          eastern Pacific Ocean, particularly:<br />
          The Gal√°pagos Islands (home to a large and well-known population)<br />
          Western coasts of Central and South America, especially in countries
          like Ecuador, Peru, and Mexico.<br />
          They inhabit rocky shores, islands, and coastal cliffs, nesting in
          open, flat areas free from vegetation. Their habitat is always close
          to rich fishing grounds, since they rely heavily on marine life to
          survive and raise their young.
        </p>

        <h3>Feeding Habits</h3>
        <p>
          Blue-footed Boobies are skilled marine predators, feeding mainly
          on:<br />
          Small fish such as anchovies, sardines, and mackerel<br />
          Occasionally, squid and crustaceans.<br />
          Their feeding technique is both elegant and powerful. They fly high
          above the water, then dive headfirst at high speeds, folding their
          wings just before hitting the surface like a dart. These plunge-dives
          can be so precise that they catch fish swimming below the surface.
          They often hunt in groups, making their dives together to confuse and
          trap schools of fish.<br />
          Boobies have excellent eyesight and can spot fish from remarkable
          heights. Their nostrils are permanently closed to avoid water rushing
          in during dives‚Äîthey breathe through their mouths instead.
        </p>

        <h3>Breeding and Courtship</h3>
        <p>
          One of the most famous aspects of the Blue-footed Booby is its
          courtship dance‚Äîa truly unforgettable sight. The male uses his bright
          blue feet to attract a mate by performing a high-stepping dance,
          lifting each foot slowly and dramatically while showing off to the
          female. He may also present small stones or twigs and spread his wings
          in a sky-pointing display.<br />
          What makes this dance even more interesting is that:<br />
          Foot color matters: The bluer the feet, the more attractive the male.
          Brighter feet signal good health and strong genes.<br />
          If a male‚Äôs feet are pale, a female may reject him, as it could
          indicate poor nutrition or illness.<br />
          After mating, the female lays 1 to 3 eggs in a small scrape on the
          ground. Both parents take turns incubating the eggs with their feet,
          which have special blood vessels to transfer heat. Chicks hatch after
          about 40‚Äì45 days and are fed regurgitated fish by both parents.
        </p>

        <h3>Adaptations for Survival</h3>
        <p>
          The Blue-footed Booby is well adapted to its marine environment:<br />
          Webbed blue feet aid in swimming and are key to mate selection.<br />
          Streamlined bodies and strong wings allow for long-distance flying and
          agile diving.<br />
          Salt glands above their eyes help remove excess salt from seawater,
          which they excrete through their nostrils.<br />
          Excellent vision helps them track prey from high above the ocean.<br />
          Despite their awkwardness on land, they are powerful and graceful in
          the air and water.
        </p>

        <h3>Niche and Ecological Role</h3>
        <p>
          As top-level fish predators, Blue-footed Boobies help maintain the
          balance of fish populations in the ocean. Their diet and behavior are
          influenced by ocean conditions, making them indicators of ocean
          health. During events like El Ni√±o, when water temperatures rise and
          fish become scarce, booby populations may suffer reduced breeding
          success.<br />
          Their colonies also contribute guano (droppings), which enriches the
          surrounding soil and supports other island life.
        </p>

        <h3>Unique & Fascinating Facts</h3>
        <p>
          Both parents share duties equally‚Äîfrom incubation to feeding, making
          them excellent partners.<br />
          They can dive from heights of up to 25 meters (80 feet) and swim
          underwater to chase fish.<br />
          Chicks compete for food, and sometimes siblicide occurs when food is
          scarce‚Äîthe stronger chick may push its sibling out of the nest.Despite
          their silly name, Blue-footed Boobies are intelligent and strategic
          hunters.<br />
          Their feet lose brightness if they are not well-fed or healthy, making
          foot color an honest signal of fitness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Blue-footed Booby's name comes from the Spanish word "bobo," which
          means "fool" or "clown," likely due to their clumsy movements on land.
          They are also known as "blue-footed boobies" to distinguish them from
          other booby species, such as the Red-footed Booby and the Nazca Booby.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Blue-footed Booby is a protected species in many areas, and
          conservation efforts focus on preserving their nesting habitats and
          monitoring populations to ensure their survival in the wild.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Blue-footed Booby is a popular subject of study for scientists
          interested in evolution, behavior, and ecology. Their unique mating
          rituals and adaptations provide valuable insights into the processes
          of natural selection and sexual selection.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Blue-footed Booby's feet are not only a mating signal but also
          serve a practical purpose. Their webbed feet help them swim efficiently
          in the ocean, allowing them to catch fish and evade predators.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Blue-footed Booby's migration patterns are not well understood,
          but they are known to travel long distances in search of food and
          suitable breeding grounds. They are capable of flying at speeds of up
          to 40 miles per hour (64 kilometers per hour) during migration.

          The cassowary is one of the most remarkable birds walking the Earth
          today. With its dinosaur-like appearance, vibrant coloring, and
          reputation as one of the most dangerous birds in the world, the
          cassowary is as fascinating as it is fearsome. Native to the tropical
          forests of northern Australia, New Guinea, and surrounding islands,
          this flightless bird plays a vital role in its ecosystem‚Äîand commands
          respect from anyone who crosses its path.
        </p>
        <h3>Species of Cassowary</h3>
        <p>
          There are three species of cassowary:<br />

          1.
          <abbr title="pictured above"
            ><b>Sourthern Cassowary (Casuarius casuarius)</b></abbr
          >‚Äì the most well-known and widely studied<br />
          2. Northern Cassowary (Casuarius unappendiculatus)<br />
          3. Dwarf Cassowary (Casuarius bennetti)<br />
          The Southern Cassowary is the largest and most iconic, often referred
          to when people mention ‚Äúthe cassowary.‚Äù
        </p>
        <h3>Habitat</h3>
        <p>
          Cassowaries inhabit dense tropical rainforests, swamps, and mangroves
          in northern Australia, New Guinea, and nearby islands. They prefer
          areas with thick vegetation that provides cover and abundant food
          sources. These birds are solitary and territorial, often establishing
          large home ranges that they defend from other cassowaries. Their
          primary range includes:<br />
          Northern Queensland, Australia+<br />
          New Guinea and surrounding islands<br />
          Parts of Indonesia<br />
          They rely on thick vegetation and ample fruit supplies, as they are
          mostly forest dwellers, using their powerful legs to move through the
          underbrush and escape danger.
        </p>
        <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
        <p>
          The cassowary looks like something out of prehistory:<br />
          It can grow up to 6.6 feet (2 meters) tall and weigh over 130 pounds
          (60 kg). It has coarse black feathers that resemble hair. Its head and
          neck are brightly colored in blue, red, and purple, with color
          intensity increasing during mating season. On top of its head sits a
          casque‚Äîa helmet-like structure made of keratin and bone, whose exact
          function is still debated. It may help with sound amplification, head
          protection, or moving through dense vegetation. But the most iconic
          (and dangerous) part of the cassowary is its feet: each has three
          toes, and the inner toe sports a dagger-like claw up to 5 inches (12
          cm) long‚Äîcapable of inflicting serious injuries.
        </p>
        <h3>Feeding Habits</h3>
        <p>
          Cassowaries are omnivorous, but their diet is largely frugivorous
          (fruit-based). They consume:<br />
          A wide variety of fallen tropical fruits<br />
          Fungi, insects, small animals, and even dead mammals if necessary<br />
          Their strong beaks and digestive systems allow them to eat toxic or
          tough fruits that other animals cannot. Remarkably, cassowaries play a
          crucial ecological role as seed dispersers. Many rainforest plants
          rely on cassowaries to eat their fruit and deposit the seeds‚Äîoften far
          away, complete with natural fertilizer from their droppings.
        </p>
        <h3>Behavior and Movement</h3>
        <p>
          They are:<br />

          Excellent runners, capable of reaching 50 km/h (31 mph) through dense
          jungle<br />

          Strong swimmers, often crossing rivers and even swimming in the
          ocean<br />

          Silent movers, but they can produce deep booming sounds, which may
          help them communicate through thick forests<br />

          Despite their shy nature, when threatened‚Äîespecially if cornered or
          protecting eggs-they can become extremely aggressive. There have been
          recorded attacks on humans, sometimes causing serious injuries or,
          rarely, death.

        <h3>Breeding and Parenting</h3>
        <p>
          Cassowary reproduction is as fascinating as the bird itself. In a
          reversal of typical bird parenting roles:<br />

          Females are larger, more colorful, and dominant. After mating, the
          female lays 3‚Äì6 large, green eggs in a shallow ground nest. She then
          leaves‚Äîand the male takes full responsibility, the male incubates the
          eggs for about 50 days, and then raises the chicks for up to 9 months.
          During this time, he defends them fiercely, teaches them how to find
          food, and ensures they survive in the wild jungle environment.
        </p>
        <h3>Niche and Ecological Role</h3>
        <p>
          Cassowaries are known as ‚Äúkeystone species‚Äù because of their crucial
          role in seed dispersal. Some rainforest trees and plants depend
          entirely on cassowaries to reproduce. Without them, these ecosystems
          would collapse. Cassowaries also help shape the forest structure
          by:<br />
          Spreading large seeds over great distances, enabling rare or
          endangered trees to survive Because they can consume over 150
          different types of fruit, they‚Äôre sometimes called the gardeners of
          the rainforest.
        </p>
        <h3>Niche Facts and Fascinating Details</h3>
        <p>
          The cassowary casque continues growing throughout its life and may
          help age or identify individuals. Cassowaries cannot fly, but their
          strong legs make them powerful runners and jumpers. The cassowary‚Äôs
          call‚Äîa deep, low-frequency "boom"‚Äîis one of the lowest-pitched bird
          calls in the world, possibly used for long-distance communication in
          dense forests. In Aboriginal culture, cassowaries are respected and
          sometimes feared‚Äîappearing in stories and myths as guardians of the
          forest. Despite their size, they are masters of camouflage in the
          underbrush, often going unnoticed even when nearby. 
          Cassowaries are listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss, hunting,
          and vehicle collisions. Conservation efforts focus on protecting their
          habitats and educating local communities about their ecological
          importance. The cassowary is the only bird in the world with a
          "helmet" on its head, which is made of keratin (the same material as
          human nails) and can grow up to 18 inches (45 cm) tall. This casque is
          thought to help the bird navigate through dense vegetation and may also
          play a role in attracting mates during the breeding season.
          The cassowary's feet are incredibly powerful, allowing it to run
          through dense forests at speeds of up to 50 km/h (31 mph). Its inner
          toe has a sharp, dagger-like claw that can inflict serious injuries,
          making the cassowary one of the most dangerous birds in the world.
          Despite their fearsome reputation, cassowaries are generally shy and
          prefer to avoid human contact. They are primarily solitary animals,
          although they may form small groups during the breeding season or when
          food is abundant.
          Cassowaries have a unique way of communicating with each other,
          producing deep, booming calls that can be heard over long distances.
          These calls are thought to play a role in attracting mates and
          establishing territory. They are also known to produce a variety of
          other vocalizations, including hisses, grunts, and growls, depending
          on their mood and situation.
          Cassowaries have a relatively long lifespan, living up to 20‚Äì25 years
          in the wild. They reach sexual maturity at around 3‚Äì4 years of age,
            and can live up to 20‚Äì25 years in the wild. They reach sexual maturity at around 3‚Äì4 years of age, and are known for their solitary nature outside of breeding season.

          The Drongo is a small yet bold bird found across Africa, Asia, and
          Australia, famous for its aggressive attitude, sharp intelligence, and
          mimicry skills. Despite its modest size and sleek black appearance,
          the Drongo has earned a reputation as a feathered outlaw, fearlessly
          taking on larger birds and even tricking other animals to steal food.
          This combination of agility, bravery, and deception makes it one of
          the most intriguing birds in the animal kingdom.
        </p>
        <h3>Classification and Species</h3>
        <p>
          Drongos belong to the family Dicruridae, and there are about 25
          species of them. The most well-known include:<br />

          Fork-tailed Drongo (Dicrurus adsimilis) ‚Äì common in sub-Saharan
          Africa<br />

          Black Drongo (Dicrurus macrocercus) ‚Äì widespread in Asia<br />

          Ashy Drongo (Dicrurus leucophaeus) ‚Äì found in Southeast Asia<br />

          Spangled Drongo (Dicrurus bracteatus) ‚Äì found in Australia and New
          Guinea<br />

          All drongos share some key traits: mostly black or dark grey plumage,
          red or dark eyes, and a distinctive forked tail that often gives the
          impression of elegance in flight.<br />
          Pictured above is the<b></b>
        </p>
        <h3>Habitat and Distribution</h3>
        <p>
          Drongos inhabit a wide range of environments including:<br />

          Savannas, Urban gardens and farmland, Open woodlands, Forest edges<br />

          They are territorial and often perch in open view, scanning their
          surroundings for insects or intruders.
        </p>
        <h3>Feeding Habits</h3>
        <p>
          Drongos are insectivorous, feeding on:<br />

          Beetles, Grasshoppers, Wasps, Termites, Ants. Occasionally small
          birds, lizards, or fruits.<br />
          They catch prey by:<br />

          Aerial hunting (snatching insects in mid-air). Ground pouncing after
          spotting movement from a perch. But what makes drongos truly unique is
          their food-stealing strategy: some species, like the Fork-tailed
          Drongo, use deceptive mimicry to trick other animals‚Äîsuch as meerkats
          or other birds‚Äîinto dropping their food. They do this by imitating
          alarm calls, causing the animal to flee, thinking a predator is near,
          and then swooping down to snatch the abandoned food.<br />

          This behavior has earned them nicknames like:<br />

          <b>‚ÄúFeathered Trickster‚Äù</b> and <b>‚ÄúThe Liar Bird‚Äù</b>
        </p>
        <h3>Breeding and Nesting</h3>
        <p>
          Breeding usually occurs in spring and summer, depending on the region.
          Drongos build:<br />

          Small cup-shaped nests made of twigs and cobwebs. Often placed high in
          trees, well-hidden in foliage The female lays 2‚Äì4 eggs, and both
          parents help in:<br />

          Incubating eggs and feeding chicks Aggressively defending the nest
          against any intruder, regardless of size
        </p>
        <h3>Behavior and Intelligence</h3>
        <p>
          Drongos are incredibly intelligent and display:<br />

          <b>Vocal mimicry</b>: They can imitate over 30 bird species and even
          some mammals.<br />

          <b>Problem-solving skills</b>: They attack much larger birds (like
          eagles or hawks) if they come too close to their nest.<br />

          <b>Problem-solving skills</b>: In lab studies, drongos have shown the
          ability to learn, adapt, and even manipulate behavior for gain.<br />

          They are known to form temporary alliances with other birds to mob
          predators, but they're just as quick to steal from their allies when
          the chance arises.
        </p>
        <h3>Fascinating Facts</h3>
        <p>
          The Fork-tailed Drongo can fake alarm calls from meerkats, babblers,
          and other birds to trick them. Drongos are smaller than pigeons but
          will chase away hawks, crows, and even owls. Their name comes from a
          Malagasy word, and early European explorers used it to describe the
          fork-tailed species. The Black Drongo is sometimes called the ‚ÄúKing
          Crow‚Äù in parts of Asia for its boldness and upright posture.

          Drongos are often seen in pairs or small groups, but they can also be
          solitary. They are highly adaptable and can thrive in urban areas,
          often seen in gardens, parks, and agricultural fields. Their
          intelligence and adaptability make them successful in various
          environments, from rural farmlands to bustling cities.
          Drongos are known for their acrobatic flight, performing aerial
          displays that include sharp turns, dives, and glides. They are agile
          fliers, capable of catching insects mid-air and maneuvering through
          dense vegetation with ease. Their forked tails help them change
          direction quickly, making them efficient hunters.
          Drongos are also known for their social behavior, often seen
          interacting with other bird species. They can be quite vocal,
          communicating with a variety of calls and whistles. Their mimicry
          skills are not just for stealing food; they also use them to communicate
          with other drongos and to establish territory. In some cultures, drongos
          are considered symbols of intelligence and cunning. Their ability to
          mimic other birds and their bold behavior have led to various myths
          and legends about them. In some regions, they are seen as protectors
          of crops, as they help control insect populations in agricultural
          areas.
          Drongos are known to have a complex social structure, with
          hierarchies and interactions that vary by species. They can be quite  
          aggressive when defending their territory or nest, often chasing away
          larger birds and even humans who venture too close. Their boldness
          and fearless nature have made them a subject of fascination for bird
          watchers and researchers alike.

          Each species varies in size, habitat, and diet, but all are top-tier
          predators.
        </p>
        <h3>Habitat and Distribution</h3>
        <p>
          Eagles live in diverse habitats, including:<br />

          Mountains, Forests, Grasslands, Wetlands and coastal regions They are
          often found near lakes, rivers, or open areas where they can easily
          spot prey from the sky.<br />

          Eagles are territorial and require large hunting ranges. Some build
          nests on high cliffs, others in tall trees, and some even on man-made
          structures like power poles or cell towers.
        </p>
        <h3>Feeding Habits</h3>
        <p>
          Eagles are carnivorous raptors, meaning they are birds of prey. Their
          diet includes:<br />

          Fish (e.g., Bald Eagle, African Fish Eagle)<br />

          Small mammals like rabbits, hares, squirrels, and even monkeys (Harpy
          Eagle)<br />

          Reptiles and birds<br />

          Occasionally, carrion (dead animals), especially during winter<br />

          They hunt using:<br />

          Powerful talons to grab and kill prey<br />

          Sharp hooked beaks to tear flesh<br />

          Incredible eyesight, up to 4‚Äì8 times sharper than a human‚Äôs<br />

          Eagles are known for soaring silently at great heights while scanning
          the ground or water below for movement.
        </p>
        <h3>Breeding and Nesting</h3>
        <p>
          Eagles are monogamous and often mate for life. They return to the same
          nesting site each year.<br />

          Key facts about eagle breeding:<br />

          They build huge nests called eyries, which can be 2‚Äì3 meters wide and
          reused for decades. The female lays 1 to 3 eggs, and both parents help
          incubate and feed the chicks. Chicks hatch with soft down and are fed
          regurgitated food until they can eat solid meat. Young eagles, called
          eaglets, grow rapidly but may take several months before they fledge
          (leave the nest). Even after that, they often stay near their parents,
          learning to hunt and survive.
        </p>
        <h3>Behavior and Adaptations</h3>
        <p>
          Eagles are:<br />

          Solitary or paired‚Äîthey don't form large flocks<br />

          Strong fliers, capable of gliding for hours without flapping<br />

          Highly territorial, especially during nesting season<br />

          Adaptations include:<br />

          Large wingspans (up to 2.5 meters in some species)<br />

          Strong, curved talons and beaks<br />

          Exceptional vision, allowing them to spot prey from over a kilometer
          away<br />

          They can dive at speeds over 160 km/h (100 mph) when hunting.
        </p>
        <h3>Fascinating Facts</h3>
        <p>
          Bald Eagles aren‚Äôt actually bald‚Äîtheir name comes from an old word
          meaning ‚Äúwhite-headed.‚Äù Harpy Eagles have talons the size of a grizzly
          bear‚Äôs claws. Golden Eagles can carry prey up to 4 kg (9 lbs) while
          flying. Eagles have nictitating membranes‚Äîa third eyelid that protects
          their eyes during flight and while feeding. The oldest known wild
          eagle lived to be 38 years old.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eagles are often seen as symbols of power and freedom. They appear on
          national emblems, flags, and coats of arms in many countries, including
          the United States, Germany, and Mexico. The Bald Eagle was chosen as
          the national bird of the United States in 1782 due to its majestic
          appearance and association with strength and independence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eagles are also important in various cultures and mythologies. In
          Native American traditions, they are often seen as messengers between
          humans and the spirit world, representing courage, wisdom, and
          protection. In ancient Rome, eagles were associated with Jupiter, the
          king of the gods, and were used as military standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eagles are apex predators, meaning they have no natural enemies in the
          wild. However, they face threats from habitat loss, hunting, and
          poisoning. Conservation efforts have helped some species recover from
          near extinction, such as the Bald Eagle in North America.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eagles are known for their impressive courtship displays, which often
          involve aerial acrobatics, soaring, and calling
          to each other. During courtship, eagles may lock talons and tumble
          through the air, showcasing their strength and agility. This behavior
          is not only a display of fitness but also helps strengthen the bond
          between mates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eagles have a unique way of communicating with each other, using a
          variety of vocalizations, including high-pitched whistles, chirps,
          and screams. These calls can convey different messages, such as
          warning of danger, signaling territory boundaries, or attracting a mate.
          They also use body language, such as wing flapping and head movements,
          to communicate with each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eagles are highly adaptable birds, capable of living in a wide range of
          environments, from coastal areas to mountainous regions. They can
          thrive in both temperate and tropical climates, as long as there is
          sufficient food and suitable nesting sites. This adaptability has
          allowed them to colonize diverse habitats across the globe.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bald Eagle, once endangered due to hunting and pesticide use, has
          made a remarkable recovery thanks to conservation efforts. It was
          removed from the U.S. Endangered Species List in 2007, and its
          population has rebounded significantly in recent years.

          wide range of environments, including:<br />
          Urban areas, grasslands, forests, deserts, and coastal regions.<br />
            They prefer open spaces for hunting but also require nesting sites,
            which can include cliffs, tall trees, or even buildings and ledges.<br />
            <h3>Feeding Habits</h3>
            Falcons are carnivorous and primarily feed on:<br /><br />

            Small to medium-sized birds (their main prey)<br />
            Small mammals such as rodents and bats<br />
            Occasionally insects and reptiles<br /><br />

            They are renowned for their hunting technique called the "stoop," 
            where they dive at incredible speeds to strike prey mid-air. Falcons 
            have long, pointed wings and a notched beak, which helps them kill 
            prey quickly. Unlike hawks and eagles, falcons rely more on speed and 
            agility than sheer strength.
            </p>
            <h3>Breeding and Nesting</h3>
            <p>
            Falcons do not build traditional nests. Instead, they lay eggs on 
            cliff ledges, in tree hollows, or on tall buildings (urban falcons). 
            Key facts about falcon breeding include:<br />
            Females lay 2 to 5 eggs, which are incubated mainly by the female.<br />
            Both parents feed the chicks, which fledge after about 5‚Äì7 weeks.<br />
            Young falcons learn to hunt by practicing aerial maneuvers and chasing prey.
            </p>
            <h3>Behavior and Adaptations</h3>
            <p>
            Falcons are solitary hunters and are highly territorial during 
            breeding season. Adaptations include:<br />
            Exceptional eyesight for spotting prey from great distances<br />
            Streamlined bodies and long wings for high-speed flight<br />
            A tomial tooth (notch) on the beak for efficiently dispatching prey<br />
            They are also known for their intelligence and ability to adapt to 
            urban environments, where they may nest on skyscrapers and hunt city pigeons.

        </p>
        <p>
          The secretary bird is a large, terrestrial bird of prey native to
          sub-Saharan Africa. Unlike most birds of prey, it spends most of its
          time on the ground, using its long legs and powerful strides to hunt
          across savannas and grasslands.
        </p>
        <h3>Appearance</h3>
        <p>
          Standing up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) tall, the secretary bird is
          instantly recognizable. It has an eagle-like body with a hawk‚Äôs hooked
          beak, but it walks on long crane-like legs. Its plumage is mostly gray
          with black flight feathers and tail tips. What truly stands out is its
          crest of long black feathers on the back of its head, said to resemble
          18th-century clerks who used to tuck quills behind their ears ‚Äî hence
          the name "secretary" bird
        </p>

        <h3>Habitat and Range</h3>
        <p>
          The secretary bird is found in open grasslands and savannahs, avoiding
          dense forests and deserts. Its range spans much of sub-Saharan Africa,
          from Senegal and Ethiopia down to South Africa.
        </p>
        <h3>Diet and Hunting</h3>
        <p>
          Secretary birds are carnivorous and feed mainly on insects, rodents,
          reptiles, and small mammals. However, they are best known for their
          ability to kill snakes ‚Äî even venomous ones like cobras and puff
          adders. They use their long legs and sharp talons to stomp or kick
          prey with incredible force and precision. Their legs are covered with
          scales for protection against bites.
        </p>
        <h3>Behavior</h3>
        <p>
          They are diurnal and hunt mostly during the day, often seen walking
          through the grass, scanning for movement. Secretary birds live in
          pairs or small family groups and are known for their large home
          ranges.
        </p>
        <h3>Breeding</h3>
        <p>
          Unique Facts Despite being a bird of prey, it rarely flies unless
          threatened or roosting. Its kicks can exert a force of five times its
          own body weight ‚Äî enough to break a snake‚Äôs spine. It has featured on
          several African emblems and coats of arms, including South Africa's
          national emblem. The secretary bird is a remarkable example of
          evolution, combining the traits of raptors and ground-dwelling birds
          into one powerful and elegant predator.
