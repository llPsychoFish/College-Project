        <h1>Birds</h1>
        <p class="par">Birds are warm-blooded vertebrates belonging to the class Aves. They are characterized by feathers, beaks without teeth, lightweight skeletons, and the ability to lay hard-shelled eggs. Most birds can fly, thanks to their strong chest muscles and wings, although some species like ostriches, emus, and penguins are flightless.
        There are over 10,000 known species of birds found on every continent, from icy Antarctica to tropical rainforests. Birds have excellent vision, which helps them hunt, navigate, and avoid danger. Many species are known for their melodious calls and songs, used for communication and attracting mates. Birds play vital roles in the environment. They help pollinate plants, disperse seeds, and control insect populations. Some birds, like eagles and vultures, are scavengers and help clean up the environment by feeding on dead animals.
        Birds also hold cultural and spiritual significance in many societies and are a major focus of birdwatching, a popular hobby around the world.</p>

      <h2>Artic Tern</h2>
      <img src="list_image/artic tern.jpg" alt="Artic Tern">
      <p>Scientific Name: <b>Sterna paradisaea</b></P>

        <P>The Arctic Tern is a small seabird renowned not for its size, but for its extraordinary endurance and adaptability. Known as one of the greatest travelers in the animal kingdom, this bird annually performs a round-trip migration from the Arctic to the Antarctic, covering tens of thousands of kilometers. With elegant white plumage, sharp red beaks, and streamlined bodies, Arctic Terns are as beautiful as they are biologically fascinating.</P>
      
        <h3>Habitat</h3>  
        <p>Arctic Terns breed in Arctic and sub-Arctic regions, including Greenland, Iceland, Alaska, and northern parts of Canada, Europe, and Russia. Their nesting sites are typically coastal tundra, rocky islands, and beaches. During the non-breeding season, they fly to the Antarctic Circle, spending their time in cold southern oceans, far away from human settlements. This extreme migration allows them to experience two summers per year, giving them more daylight than any other animal on Earth.</p>
        
        <h3>Feeding Habits</h3>   
        <b>Habitat</b>
       
       <p> Arctic Terns breed in Arctic and sub-Arctic regions, including Greenland, Iceland, Alaska, and northern parts of Canada, Europe, and Russia. Their nesting sites are typically coastal tundra, rocky islands, and beaches. During the non-breeding season, they fly to the Antarctic Circle, spending their time in cold southern oceans, far away from human settlements. This extreme migration allows them to experience two summers per year, giving them more daylight than any other animal on Earth.</p>
        
       <b>Feeding Habits</b> 
        
        <p>Arctic Terns are carnivorous, feeding mainly on small fish and marine invertebrates like shrimp and krill. They forage by hovering above the water and diving to catch prey near the surface. Sometimes, they also pick insects from land or water, especially during breeding when food must be plentiful for their chicks. Their sharp eyesight helps them spot fish underwater, and their fast, agile flight aids in quick capture.</p>
        
        <h3>Migration</h3>
        <p> Every year, the Arctic Tern travels from the Arctic to the Antarctic and back again, making a round trip of about 70,000 to 80,000 kilometers (43,000 to 50,000 miles)‚Äîthe longest known migration in the animal kingdom. They follow a zigzag route, catching favorable wind currents and stopping at key feeding sites along the way. This journey is not only a test of endurance but also a demonstration of how finely attuned these birds are to Earth's geography and weather systems.</p>
        
        <h3>Breeding and Life Cycle</h3>  
        <P>Breeding takes place during the Arctic summer, when daylight is nearly continuous. Arctic Terns are monogamous and often return to the same breeding grounds‚Äîand even the same mate‚Äîyear after year. They lay 1 to 3 eggs in shallow ground nests lined with grass and feathers. Both parents share in incubation and feeding the chicks.<br>
          Once hatched, the chicks are semi-precocial: they are born with down and can walk, but they rely on their parents for food. Fledging occurs after about three to four weeks, and not long after, the long migration south begins.</P>
        
        <h3>Niche and Ecological Role</h3>
        <P>The Arctic Tern plays a key role in the marine ecosystem. As predators of small fish and invertebrates, they help control these populations. They are also indicators of ocean health; changes in their migration patterns or breeding success can reflect shifts in fish populations or ocean temperatures due to climate change.<br>
          Moreover, they have few natural predators due to their remote nesting locations, though eggs and chicks are vulnerable to foxes, gulls, and skuas. Humans pose threats through habitat disturbance, climate change, and pollution. Fortunately, they are currently listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, though local populations may vary in status.</P>
        
        <h3>Facts</h3>  
        <P>An individual Arctic Tern can fly over 2.5 million kilometers in its lifetime‚Äîenough to reach the Moon and back more than three times.<br>
          They have a lifespan of around 30 years, meaning they may see more daylight than any other animal.<br>
          During migration, they feed along the way, often stopping in the North Atlantic, off the coast of Africa, or near New Zealand, depending on the route.<br>
          Despite their graceful appearance, they are highly aggressive around their nests and will dive-bomb humans and predators alike.

      <h2>Blue-Footed Booby</h2>
      <img src="list_image/blue foot.jpg" alt="Blue-Footed Booby">
       <p>Scientific Name :<b> Sula nebouxii</b></p>
      <P>Type : <abbr title="Non-raptor birds are a diverse group that feed on seeds, fruits,fish, insects, or nectar"><b>Non-raptor</b></abbr></P>
      <p>The Blue-footed Booby is one of the most iconic seabirds in the world, instantly recognizable by its bright turquoise-blue feet and comical behavior. Native to the eastern Pacific coastline, this bird combines beauty, skill, and quirkiness, making it a favorite among wildlife watchers and scientists alike. Behind its playful appearance lies a bird perfectly adapted to life at sea and a fascinating case of natural selection and mate choice.</p>
      <b>Habitat and Distribution</b>
      <p>The Blue-footed Booby is mainly found along the coastal regions of the eastern Pacific Ocean, particularly:

        The Gal√°pagos Islands (home to a large and well-known population)
        
        Western coasts of Central and South America, especially in countries like Ecuador, Peru, and Mexico
        
        
        They inhabit rocky shores, islands, and coastal cliffs, nesting in open, flat areas free from vegetation. Their habitat is always close to rich fishing grounds, since they rely heavily on marine life to survive and raise their young.
        </p>
        Feeding Habits  
       <p>Blue-footed Boobies are skilled marine predators, feeding mainly on:

        Small fish such as anchovies, sardines, and mackerel
        
        Occasionally, squid and crustaceans
        
        
        Their feeding technique is both elegant and powerful. They fly high above the water, then dive headfirst at high speeds, folding their wings just before hitting the surface like a dart. These plunge-dives can be so precise that they catch fish swimming below the surface. They often hunt in groups, making their dives together to confuse and trap schools of fish.
        
        Boobies have excellent eyesight and can spot fish from remarkable heights. Their nostrils are permanently closed to avoid water rushing in during dives‚Äîthey breathe through their mouths instead.</p>
        Breeding and Courtship
        <p>One of the most famous aspects of the Blue-footed Booby is its courtship dance‚Äîa truly unforgettable sight. The male uses his bright blue feet to attract a mate by performing a high-stepping dance, lifting each foot slowly and dramatically while showing off to the female. He may also present small stones or twigs and spread his wings in a sky-pointing display.

            What makes this dance even more interesting is that:
            
            Foot color matters: The bluer the feet, the more attractive the male. Brighter feet signal good health and strong genes.
            
            If a male‚Äôs feet are pale, a female may reject him, as it could indicate poor nutrition or illness.
            
            
            After mating, the female lays 1 to 3 eggs in a small scrape on the ground. Both parents take turns incubating the eggs with their feet, which have special blood vessels to transfer heat. Chicks hatch after about 40‚Äì45 days and are fed regurgitated fish by both parents.</p> 
        Adaptations for Survival  
        <p>The Blue-footed Booby is well adapted to its marine environment:

            Webbed blue feet aid in swimming and are key to mate selection.
            
            Streamlined bodies and strong wings allow for long-distance flying and agile diving.
            
            Salt glands above their eyes help remove excess salt from seawater, which they excrete through their nostrils.
            
            Excellent vision helps them track prey from high above the ocean.
            
            
            Despite their awkwardness on land, they are powerful and graceful in the air and water.</p> 
        Niche and Ecological Role 
        <p>As top-level fish predators, Blue-footed Boobies help maintain the balance of fish populations in the ocean. Their diet and behavior are influenced by ocean conditions, making them indicators of ocean health. During events like El Ni√±o, when water temperatures rise and fish become scarce, booby populations may suffer reduced breeding success.

            Their colonies also contribute guano (droppings), which enriches the surrounding soil and supports other island life.</p>
        Unique & Fascinating Facts 
        <p>Both parents share duties equally‚Äîfrom incubation to feeding, making them excellent partners.

            They can dive from heights of up to 25 meters (80 feet) and swim underwater to chase fish.
            
            Chicks compete for food, and sometimes siblicide occurs when food is scarce‚Äîthe stronger chick may push its sibling out of the nest.Despite their silly name, Blue-footed Boobies are intelligent and strategic hunters.

            Their feet lose brightness if they are not well-fed or healthy, making foot color an honest signal of fitness.</p>
