      <h1>Mammals</h1>
      <p class="par">
        Mammals are warm-blooded vertebrates known for having hair or fur on
        their bodies and for feeding their young with milk produced by special
        glands called mammary glands. They have a backbone, breathe air through
        lungs, and most give birth to live young (with a few exceptions like the
        platypus and echidna, which lay eggs). Mammals are highly diverse and
        include animals such as humans, dogs, whales, elephants, and bats. They
        are found in nearly every environment on Earth, from deep oceans to high
        mountains. thanks to their adaptability and complex behavior.

      <h2>Dingo</h2>
      <img src="list_image/dingo.jpg" alt="Dingo" />

      <p>
        The dingo is one of Australia's most unique wild animals. Though it
        resembles a domestic dog, it is a separate species that has lived in the
        wild for thousands of years. Adaptable and intelligent, the dingo plays
        a crucial role in Australia's ecosystems but also creates tension with
        farmers. This essay explores the dingo‚Äôs appearance, habitat, diet,
        behavior, role in the ecosystem, human interaction, and includes some
        fascinating facts about this remarkable animal.
      </p>
      <h3>Appearance</h3>
      <p>
        Dingoes have a sleek, athletic build ideal for running and hunting.
        Their fur is usually golden-yellow, but can also be reddish, black, or
        white. They have upright ears, almond-shaped eyes, and a bushy tail.
        Adult dingoes typically weigh between 13 to 24 kilograms and stand about
        50 to 60 centimeters tall at the shoulder
      </p>
      <h3>Habitat</h3>
      <p>
        Dingoes are incredibly adaptable and live in deserts, grasslands,
        tropical forests, and even alpine areas. They are especially common in
        central and northern Australia but are less common in the southern
        regions due to farming and fencing.
      </p>
      <h3>Diet</h3>
      <p>
        Dingoes are skilled hunters and feed on a wide variety of animals. Their
        diet includes rabbits, birds, reptiles, rodents, and sometimes larger
        prey like kangaroos and wallabies. They also scavenge food when
        necessary.
      </p>
      <h3>Behavior and Social Structure</h3>
      <p>
        Dingoes are intelligent, social animals. They may live alone, in pairs,
        or in packs. In a pack, only the dominant male and female usually breed,
        while the others help care for the pups. They communicate through
        howling, scent marking, and body language.
      </p>
      <h3>Role in the Ecosystem</h3>
      <p>
        Dingoes play the role of apex predator in many Australian ecosystems.
        They help control populations of rabbits, wallabies, and feral animals
        like foxes and cats, which can threaten native species.
      </p>
      <h3>Interaction with Humans</h3>
      <p>
        While dingoes help maintain ecological balance, they are often in
        conflict with farmers, especially in sheep-farming areas. To protect
        livestock, farmers have used fences, traps, and poison baits. However,
        conservationists argue that dingoes should be protected due to their
        ecological importance.
      </p>
      <h3>Interesting Facts</h3>
      <p>
        Dingoes are believed to be the oldest breed of dog still living in the
        wild, having arrived in Australia over 4,000 years ago‚Äîlong before
        European settlers.<br />
        Studies show that where dingoes thrive, smaller predators like foxes and
        feral cats are less common‚Äîthis effect is known as
        <b>"mesopredator suppression"</b> and helps protect native wildlife.<br />
        Dingoes do not bark as much as domestic dogs. Instead, they howl‚Äîoften
        in a rising and falling tone‚Äîwhich can carry long distances through the
        bush.<br />
        In some areas, dingoes have been seen cooperating with wedge-tailed
        eagles by circling prey, making it easier for both the bird and the
        dingo to hunt successfully.<br />
        One of the longest man-made structures in the world, the Dingo Fence,
        stretches over 5,600 kilometers across Australia. It was built to keep
        dingoes out of southeastern farmlands.
